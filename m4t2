// Reflection
// I think a good prompt is asking the bot to walk you through the process instead of doing it all by itself.
// A bad prompt would be asking it to do everything for you without understanding the process.
// I learned that AI assistants can be very helpful but you should not totally rely on them.
// If I did this again I would probably exapnd on the prompts more and add a lot more to the original story.
